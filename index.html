          We are a Cyber Security Working Group aiming to improve cyber security
          practices and education for Amateur Radio service users. Our group is
          globally inclusive, welcoming members and information from all around
          the world. We primarily use English for our communications and
          discussions. We operate as a committee, focusing on vulnerabilities
          related to Amateur Radio services.
        </p>

          We are also a lobbyist group which advocates for the use of encryption
          on Amateur radio for sending sensitive information such as passwords,
          and also for experimentation purposes keeping in the spirit of Amateur
          Radio. We believe that this is a crucial step towards ensuring the
          security and privacy of all users.
