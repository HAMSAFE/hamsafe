Alert: Beware of Romance Scams Targeting Amateur Radio Users

Dear Amateur Radio Community,

It has come to our attention that a concerning trend is emerging within
our community - romance scams targeting users of mobile radio services,
particularly those active on social media platforms such as Facebook,
Instagram, and X (formerly known as Twitter).

These scams typically involve the creation of attractive fake user
profiles, often featuring images of individuals of Asian descent, who
claim to be located in distant locales like China. These fraudulent
profiles initiate contact with amateur radio operators, showing interest
in their content, liking posts, and sending friend requests. Once
accepted, the scammers engage in conversations, often sharing photos of
food, beaches, or other images to build rapport.

However, the conversation quickly takes a sinister turn as these
scammers attempt to lure their victims into cryptocurrency investment
schemes. They present enticing opportunities for financial gain, urging
users to invest in fraudulent schemes via cryptocurrency exchanges.
Regrettably, these investments prove to be nothing more than elaborate
scams, resulting in the loss of hard-earned funds with no hope of
recovery.

It's crucial for our community to be vigilant and aware of these
malicious activities. Romance scams often target older individuals who
may be more susceptible due to factors such as loneliness or a desire
for companionship. Moreover, many amateur radio operators are further
along in their life journey and may possess resources that scammers seek
to exploit.

To protect yourself and your fellow operators from falling victim to
these scams, we urge you to exercise caution when engaging with
unfamiliar individuals on social media platforms. Be wary of unsolicited
friend requests or messages, especially from profiles with scant or
dubious information. Remember, legitimate investment opportunities are
rarely presented via social media, and any requests for financial
transactions should be thoroughly vetted and researched.

If you encounter suspicious behavior or believe you may have been
targeted by a romance scam, please report it to the appropriate
authorities immediately. By remaining vigilant and informed, we can
collectively safeguard our community from falling prey to these deceitful
tactics.

Stay safe and stay vigilant. 73's.
